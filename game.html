    <h3 id="title">Snake Game</h3>
    <p id="body-normal">This is a simple snake game I made for a project, which uses both # via WinForms and has the basic functionalities of snake, as well as a few additional personal features.</p>
    <p id="body-normal">The game allowed you to pick from two characters, as well as had levels, where each level, you would have to collect a certain amount of 'apples' before moving on. I was also able to implement a leaderboard feature that worked and displayed for what character you chose.</p>
    <p id="body-normal">This was my first venture into game development informally, as well as taught me C#, which was fairly unknown to me at the time, but my experience with it has improved over time.</p>
