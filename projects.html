					<h2>Python Projects</h2>
                    <p>This is a list of all the Python Projects I have completed, of which the full code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/TanYongHao/PersonalProjects">here</a>.</p>

							<h3>Number Guesser</h3>
                            <img src="images/index 2.PNG" alt="NumberGuesser.py" class="image" />
							
								<li>This was my first ever project using Python as I made a number guesser, where it would randomly generate a number using the .randint function and would tell you if the number you guessed was too high or too low. It took me 15 minutes to complete this project.</li>
                    
						    <h3>Basic Adventure Game</h3>
                            <img src="images/index 3.PNG" alt="BattleBeginner.py" class="image" />
							
								<li>This was my second project made using Python, utilising more concepts newer to me such as dictionaries and more "While" and "If" functions, allowing the player to experience a basic programmed storyline where you traverse through a city killing monsters. It took me 2 hours to complete this project. .</li>
							
                             <h3>Basic Infinite Battle Game</h3>
                             <img src="images/index 1.PNG" alt="DungeonCrawler.py" class="image1" />
							
								<li>This was my third project made using Python, further developing upon the concepts learned from my second project to expand upon and code into a more advanced programme. The programme has you continously fighting enemies infinitely, levelling up as you further go along. The battle system includes an option to "Attack", "Defend" and "Run", allowing the player to make more choices rather an just attack. This is my most worked-on project, and I am currently working on expanding it further through more advanced concepts or even utilising other coding languages to transform it into a game. It has taken me 6 hours to get to this point so far.</li>

							<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
                            <img src="images/index 4.PNG" alt="index.html" class="image" />					
								<li>With the help of a template from <a href = "https://HTML5Up.com">this website</a>, I was able to have a base I could work on and alter, eventually becoming this current Portfolio you are reading. It has been uploaded to GitHub and uses GitHub Pages. It took me 8 hours to complete this project.</li>
