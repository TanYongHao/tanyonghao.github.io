						<li>
							<h3>Applied Artifical Intelligence - <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9500127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Use of Chatbots in Digital Business Transformation: A Systematic Literature Review</a></h3>
							<p>This shows one of the ways how Artificial Intelligence is utilised in business, as Chatbots to interact with humans as customer support or to assist customers by recommending products utilising their knowledge. I think this shows the potential of Artificial Intelligence, especially within the Business sector and how it is able to benefit companies through being able to predict what products customers will or will not favour, as well as being able to cut down on manpower costs in regards to customer support. However, there is still singificant potential within the field of Artificial Intelligence and the public's perception and willingness to communicate with an AI rather than a human, which shows how the field of AI is still in its infancy stage and the potential of it to be developed. Thus, I believe the field of Artificial Intelligence has significant potential to help both organsiations and individuals respectively through decreasing costs and efficiently purchasing items online, proving the importance of the field in the near future.</p>

							<h3>Big Data & Analytics - <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9367128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementing Big Data Analytics in E-Commerce: Vendor and Customer View</a></h3>
							<p>This shows one of the ways Data Analytics is used in organisations to benefit both organisations and individuals, through the analysis of data in the field of E-Commerce, pointing E-Commerce Businesses in the right direction, improving the experiences of individuals who use E-Commerce as well as increase the revenue of businesses and attract more customers. This shows how data analysis is prominent within the field of Information Technology, and its usages signficiantly benefit both the organisation and the individual. I believe in the future, the analysis of data can be made more efficient and easier and allow its implementation further into other industries like Finance or Manufacturing to improve communication between organisations and individuals on what is important to them.  </p>

							<h3>Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics - <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8963730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Capabilities to Improve Cybersecurity</a></h3>
							<p>Throughout recent years, the digitalisation of information from Banking to Healthcare has left cybersecurity a significant subfield in the field of IT, as the subfield rapidly develops to combat any digital threats that pop up each and every day. As such, I believe that the field has potential and will continue to grow and develop over the next decade as digital threats continue to develop alongside cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is important to every industry within Information Technology as both organisations and individuals wish to protect their privacy, showing its importance. It is also a subfield which interacts with other subfields, such as AI in the above article or other subfields such as Data Analysis to develop further. Thus, I believe it is an important sector of IT and will always be relevant, regardless of any advancements in the field of IT for decades to come.</p>

							<h3>Immersive Media & Game Development - <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517709001332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual reality: Applications and implications for tourism</a></h3>
							<p>This shows one of the ways Immersive Media can be developed and utilised in the Tourism industry. In the article, it shows how Vritual Reality can be utilised as immersive media in order to allow tourists to view sites or locations without even having to leave the comfort of their own homes whilst experiencing an immersive and realistic experience. I believe this subfield is still developing and can be further improved on to provide a more immersive and enjoyable experience, allowing organisations to provide experiences at a fraction of a cost and allow individuals to explore and experience locations without having to take any risk. As a whole, Immersive Media and Game Development is still developing with the introduction of new applications such as Unreal Engine 5 or more immersive Augmented and Virtual Reality, showing its potential in the future.</p>

							<h3>Information Technology - <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information Technology as Tools for Cancer Registry and Regional Cancer Network Integration</a></h3>
							<p>This article shows one of the ways Information Technology can be used to benefit both organisations and individuals. The article shows how IT can be used as tools to build a connected cancer registry to be able to effectively collect data, as well as analysise it for trends and to aid in research in cancer research. As a whole, I believe Information Technology is crucial to the entire field, being used in every subfield within IT, as well as being able to work together with other subfields such as Data Analysis or AI to develop trends. As such, I believe this field will stay relevant and has a lot to be developed upon.</p>
