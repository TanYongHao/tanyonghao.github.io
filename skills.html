					<h1 style="text-align: center;">Skills</h1>
					<p style="text-align: center;">This is a list of skills that I believe are integral for this course and I believe will be able to help me excel at it. They are divided into two seperate categories, skills regarding the field of IT and Information Technology and personal skills. </p>

					<div class="points">
						<div class="point">
							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Basic Python Skills</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I picked up Python due to my own interests a year ago, spending my free time to work on it and develop my skills in it, eventually becoming confident enough to begin personal projects to further my skills and utilise them in actual code.</li>
							
						    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Basic Unity Experience</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I picked up Unity alongisde Python due to my slight interest in game development, using the official Unity Learning website to develop my fundamentals in the engine.</li>
							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Intermediate Lego Mindstorms Experience</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I got to learn Lego Mindstorms during my Secondary School Infcomm Club for three years, from Secondary 1 to Secondary 3, where I was able to pick up various skills regarding it and participate in competitions utilising the skill.</li>
							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Intermediate micro:bit Experience</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I got to learn micro:bit during my Primary School Infocomm Club for three years, from Primary 3 to Primary 6. I was able to pick up on the usages of micro:bit and use it in action during CCA.</li>
							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Basic Drones Experience</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I got to learn about Drones during both Primary School and Secondary School from Primary 3 to Primary 4 and my Secondary School's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) during Secondary One. During so, I was able to learn about how drones function and their usages, from videography to delivery to more.</li>
							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Basic HTML Skills</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I recently picked up HTML as I learned that it was an integral part of this course, as well as because I believe that it would pair well with my already existing Python skills to allow me to gain knowledge on how Front-End Development works and how it interacts with Back-End Development. I was able to utilise my HTML skills to alter this website to an appealing and readable portfolio.</li>

							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Leadership</h3>
							
								<li style="text-align: center;">I learned to lead others, similarly during Infocomm Club sessions as a Secondary One mentor as well as competitions, where I was able to direct my fellow teammates to tasks and advise them whenever they needed help.</li>
							<h3 style="text-align: center;">Critical Thinking</h3>
							
							<li style="text-align: center;">I was able to pick up critical thinking through CCA Sessions as well as whilst working on my own personal projects, where I struggled often with code that resulted in error but was able to overcome these challenges by analysing and solve the problem.</li>
