    <h3 id="title">Movie Website</h3>
    <p id="body-normal">This is a movie website I made for a school project, using HTML, CSS and JS, as well as PHP to deal with the backend of the code.</p>
    <p id="body-normal">The website allowed you to create and log into your accounts, book and cancel movies, as well as display current movies. Through this, I learned a lot about having to adapt to different resolutions for screens regarding both mobile and computers, as well as how to utilise PHP.</p>
